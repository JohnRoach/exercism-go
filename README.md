# What is this?

My go exercises I work on the weekends to learn the basics a little better for go.

# Where did you get these problems?

exercism.io

# Were they worth it?

They definitely allowed me to understand some concepts a little better.

# Will you be working on a Go project soon?

Maybe. It does look like an interesting language.

# Will you actually finish the said theoretical project?

Haha. Very funny.
